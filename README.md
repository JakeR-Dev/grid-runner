# Grid Runner

Play the game at: https://jaker-dev.github.io/grid-runner/

The Goal: collect as many 'signals' as possible without letting the enemies touch you.

Built with:
- React
- Vite
- SCSS

## Compile assets

- Be sure you're running Node v24+
- From project root, run `npm run dev`

## Deployment

- From project root, run `npm run deploy`

This builds assets and deploys them to the `gh-pages` branch. The Github Pages site is set to deploy specifically from that `gh-pages` branch.
